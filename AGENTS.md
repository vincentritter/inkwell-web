Hello, robot! 👋

This project (Inkwell) is a web-based feed reader for RSS and JSON Feeds. It syncs with Micro.blog, which adopts a flavor of the Feedbin API. There is documentation for Feedbin in the docs/feedbin folder.

Style:

* Local variables use snake_case with underscores.
* Prefer using real tabs instead of spaces for HTML, CSS, and JS indentation.
* Prefer == instead of ===, and != instead of !==.

Frameworks:

* Pico CSS.
* Stimulus JS.
* Otherwise plain HTML and JavaScript, keep things simple and standard.
